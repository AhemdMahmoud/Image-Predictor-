# Image Prediction Web App with Streamlit

### This project involves developing a `web application` using Streamlit and `train Deep learning model` to `predict the contents of uploaded images`. The application provides a simple and interactive interface for users to upload images and receive predictions based on the trained model. `This can be particularly useful for tasks such as image classification, object detection, or other image-based predictions`
